The boost_headers.tgz file is a tarball of boost 1.54

This was generated using the "bcp" utility that comes with boost.

To generate this file, download boost, cd into the boost source
directory and then type;

./bootstrap.sh

cd tools/bcp/

../../bjam

This will create the "bcp" utility in the boost bin directory
(on my mac, this is bin.v2/tools/bcp/darwin-4.2.1/release/link-static/bcp)

I copy this file into my path.

To generate the list of needed boost header files, type

mkdir tmp
bcp --scan /path/to/corelib/src/libs/*/* --boost=/path/to/boost_1_54_0/ ./tmp

This will copy all of the header files into tmp/boost

Simply tar this up and you have the file :-)
