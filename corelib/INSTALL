Sire 1.0 release candidate

Installation instructions
=========================

A. INSTALL THE DEPENDENCIES

First, make sure that you have downloaded and installed all
of the dependencies of Sire. These are;

(0) Functioning C++ and C compilers (recommend gcc >= 4.2)
(1) cmake >= 2.8
(2) Qt >= 4.5
(3) boost >= 1.5  (make sure to include boost::python)
(4) gsl >= 1.6
(5) python >= 2.5 but not python 3

(6) Optionally, to use MPI, you must have an MPI2 compatible
    library, such as mpich2 installed

The links to all of these dependencies are provided
on the Sire "Download" page on the website 
(http://siremol.org/Sire/Download.html)

B. BUILD THE CORE LIBRARIES

The next step is to compile and install the core Sire libraries.
The source for these are in the "corelib" directory. Because the
Sire build system is based on cmake, we first have to run cmake
in the build directory.

(1) cd build/corelib
(2) cmake ../../corelib

This will print out a lot of information as cmake configures Sire.
You can change any of the options during this stage by running
the command "ccmake ."

This will bring up a menu where you can set options such as 
where to install Sire, which parts of Sire to compile, optimisation
flags etc. To start with, only change the installation directory, 
as it is best to get a simple install working before trying anything
fancy.

Once cmake has run successfully you can compile and install the core
libraries using;

(3) make 
(4) make install/strip

This will install the libraries into the directory you gave in
the ccmake options page. In addition, a "sire" binary will be
produced and installed in the "bin" directory based on the
installation root. Try to run this "sire" binary to see if it 
runs without crashing. If it crashes, then get in touch on
the Sire user forums and we should be able to help you out.

You may need to ensure that the directory in which you installed
the Sire libraries is included in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH

C. BUILD THE PYTHON 2 WRAPPER LIBRARIES

The final stage of installation is to build the python 2 wrappers.
Sire is mainly used by writing python scripts, so building the
python 2 wrappers is pretty vital. First run cmake in the build/python2
directory, e.g.

(1) cd ../python2
(2) cmake ../../python2

Note that you may have to use "ccmake ." to get into the options
menu to tell cmake where you installed Sire, and to tell cmake
where to install your python libraries.

Once cmake has run successfully, make the wrappers using;

(3) make 
(4) make install/strip

Building the python wrappers can take time, so you may want to 
make it quicker by running make in parallel, e.g. "make -j 4"
if you have a quad-core machine.

You may need to ensure that the directory in which you installed
the python wrappers is included in your PYTHONPATH

D. TEST THE PROGRAM

Once everything has been installed, you can test Sire by running
some of the tests in the corelib/test directory, e.g. 

(1) cd ../../corelib
(2) sire_python test/SireMove/simulation.py

would run a Monte Carlo simulation on a box of water. 

If you have any problems or want to ask for more detail, then
please get in touch via the user forums.

Good luck :-)
