A. INSTALL THE DEPENDENCIES

First, make sure that you have downloaded and installed all
of the dependencies of Sire. These are;

(1) Functioning C++ and C compilers (recommend gcc >= 4.2)
(2) cmake >= 2.8.11.2
(3) python (for running the compilation scripts)

B. DOWNLOAD AND COMPILE THE SOURCE

Downloading and compiling Sire is controlled using a python
script called download_compile_sire.py. Simply download
this script from the Sire website and run;

python download_compile_sire.py

This will download all of the Sire source, compile it
and install it all to the current directory.

If you want help running the script type

python download_compile_sire.py --help

Once Sire has compiled, you will have a sire.app directory.
This will contain all of the Sire executables and libraries,
and can be freely copied to wherever you want to install
Sire.

To run a Sire executable, simply type;

/path/to/sire.app/bin/sire_executable

e.g., to run the Sire waterswap executable, type

/path/to/sire.app/bin/waterswap

To get help on a particular Sire executable type

/path/to/sire.app/bin/sire_executable --help

e.g.

/path/to/sire.app/bin/waterswap --help

To run all of the Sire unit tests type

/path/to/sire.app/bin/sire_test

To package your installation of Sire up into a self-extracting
executable, type

/path/to/sire.app/bin/package_sire

To update your build of Sire to the latest version, simply
rerun the "download_compile_sire.py" script in the same
directory as the source.
